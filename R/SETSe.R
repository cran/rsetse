#' SETSe algorithm
#'  
#' The basic SETSe function.
#'  
#' @param g An igraph object
#' @param force A character string. This is the node attribute that contains the force the nodes exert on the network.
#' @param distance A character string. The edge attribute that contains the original/horizontal distance between nodes.
#' @param edge_name A character string. This is the edge attribute that contains the edge_name of the edges.
#' @param k A character string. This is k for the moment don't change it.
#' @param tstep A numeric. The time interval used to iterate through the network dynamics.
#' @param mass A numeric. This is the mass constant of the nodes in normalised networks this is set to 1.
#' @param max_iter An integer. The maximum number of iterations before stopping. Larger networks usually need more iterations.
#' @param coef_drag A numeric. 
#' @param tol A numeric. The tolerance factor for early stopping.
#' @param sparse Logical. Whether or not the function should be run using sparse matrices. must match the actual matrix, this could prob be automated
#' @param two_node_solution Logical. The Newton-Raphson algo is used to find the correct angle
#' @param sample Integer. The dynamics will be stored only if the iteration number is a multiple of the sample. 
#'  This can greatly reduce the size of the results file for large numbers of iterations. Must be a multiple of the max_iter
#' @param static_limit Numeric. The maximum value the static force can reach before the algorithm terminates early. This
#' prevents calculation in a diverging system. The value should be set to some multiple greater than one of the force in the system.
#' If left blank the static limit is twice the system absolute mean force.
#' @param noisy_termination Stop the process if the static force does not monotonically decrease.
#' 
#' @details This is the basic SETS embeddings algorithm, it outputs all elements of the embeddings as well as convergence dynamics. It is a
#' wrapper around the core SETS algorithm which requires data preparation and only produces node embeddings and network dynamics. 
#' There is little reason to use this function as \code{\link{SETSe_auto}} and \code{\link{SETSe_bicomp}} 
#' are faster and easier to use.
#' 
#' @return A list of three elements. A data frame with the height embeddings of the network, a data frame of the edge embeddings
#' as well as the convergence dynamics dataframe for the network.
